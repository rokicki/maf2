#A presentation of S9 using two generators of high order.
#Total size of axioms==69+8 for inverse equations.
#This presentation was found by adding p,q as extra generators to a coxeter
#presentation together with equations    [p,a*c*d*f*g*h]=(12)(345)(6789),
#[q,a*b*c*e*f*g*h]=(1234)(56789)
#and then using recursive ordering with p,q as the first two generators
#to find a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h in terms of p and q. The original axioms were
#then translated into axioms in p,q
#Afterwards the resulting RWS was used as the basis for this presentation
#and unnecessary axioms were removed by trial and error, (with help from
#automata which reports when axioms are obviously superfluous)
