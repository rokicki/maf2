#This example verifies the nilpotence of the group using the Sims algorithm.
#The original presentation was <a,b| [b,a,b], [b,a,a,a,a], [b,a,a,a,b,a,a] >.
# (where [] mean left-normed commutators. The presentation here was derived by
#first applying the NQA to find the maximal nilpotent quotient, and then
#introducing new generators for the PCP generators.
#It is essential for success that reasonably low values of the maxstoredlen
#parameter are given.
