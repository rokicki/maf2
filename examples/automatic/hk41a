#Hyperbolic Knot 4 1 with extra generator a representing path round knot
#Presentation mentioned in Sarah Rees's Paper 
#"Automatic groups associated with orders other than shortlex"
#This presentation is much more difficult to prove automatic than the usual one
#and is not automatic using wtlex for any obvious choice of weights.
