#Borromean rings group branched of order 4
#This example is infinite shortlex automatic
#but it is very difficult to show this directly as the word acceptor
#has almost 50,000 states and trial word acceptors typically have 250,000 or
#so states, so that the multiplier is huge prior to minimisation (it still
#has almost 350000 states afterwards)
#plesken3 is the same group as this one, with a change of 
#generators.
