#Picard group PSL(2,Z[i]) - quite hard for autgroup
#This choice of generating set is consistent with the following
#set of matrices:
#a= 0 -1  t = 1 1   u = 1 i  l = -i 0  
#   1  0      0 1       0 1       0 i      
#If l is replaced by m = A *l = 0 i the group is still automatic, and the 
#                               i 0
#presentation and automata are both simpler. See picard2p
#The axioms can also be simplified for this generating set. See picard1p
