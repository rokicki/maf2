#This is a rewriting system from KBMAG. It is for a non-Abelian group of
#order 3^8 (6561)
#All three generators have order 27, though this is not at all obvious. (The
#very similar presentation obrien10 is also for such a group (according to
#the paper "Groups of Defiency Zero" from which it is taken, but
#MAF cannot find either a confluent RWS or an automatic structure for it.
#There are several files in ../pathological based on this file, using other
#choices for ordering, and generatorOrder, which MAF has a great deal of
#difficulty in processing correctly. The author has not found any other
#examples of smallish finite groups that are so difficult.
