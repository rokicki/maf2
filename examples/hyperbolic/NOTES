The most obvious families of hyperbolic wallpaper groups are the hyperbolic
triangle and Von Dyck groups T(a,b,c) and D(a,b,c) but there are plenty more
families.

If a and c are even then there is an index two subgroup generated by 
reflections a,c,bab,bcb. Note that unless both a,c, >2 then this is just 
another triangle group. Let us call this family of groups kite groups,
since the group is generated by reflections in the side of a kite, and
use the symbol K(a,b,c) for the group. 
P2MM is the only Euclidean example of this type of group

If a and b are even there is an index two subgroup generated by 
c,ab and bcb or aca.
Note that in the case where b is 2 the group is generated by just c,ab,
and in this case a pretty fundamental region is the isosceles triangle 
abc U b(abc)
Let us call this family of groups the GM family, because they are analogous to
P4GM and P31M.
