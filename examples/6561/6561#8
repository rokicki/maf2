#This is a presentation from KBMAG. It is for a non-Abelian group of order
#3^8 (6561)
#All three generators have order 27, though this is not at all obvious.
#With recursive orderings the behaviour is very unusual.
#All these examples are probably completely impossible for KBMAG, though it
#might eventually be able to do some given suitable values for the length
#restricting parameters.
#MAF can solve the presentation for some natural looking word orderings but
#not for others. The time to find the RWS varies widely, from 1 minute or
#under to possibly many hours. The times are incredibly sensitive: the
#time might be faster on a slower computer, and can vary by several orders
#of magnitude after apparently innocuous changes to the code of MAF.
#With the addition of a^27=Idword, which is true but not easily proved,
#all the examples become easy.
#This ordering is one of the fairly easy ones.
