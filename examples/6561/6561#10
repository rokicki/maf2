#obrien10 is the 10th group in the list of groups of order 6561 in the
#paper "Groups of Deficiency Zero".
#MAF can easily verify that <a,b> is a subgroup of index 27
#but it seems impossible for it to prove the group has order 6561, or
#that the subgroup has order 243, unless the commented out axiom is
#included, in which case both problems are solved in seconds
