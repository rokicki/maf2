#Subgroup of index 4 isomorphic to P2MG
#t(4,2,4) is the simplest possible presentation of P4MM. It is based on the
#reflections in the edges of an isosceles right angled triangle. Sides a & c
#are the equal legs, with side c lying on the x axis with vertex bc at the
#origin. and vertex ac at (0.5,0)
#a,b,c are reflections in the sides of this reference triangle, and
#transformations are written right to left, so that c*a means
#reflect in side a, then reflect in side c.

#In this subgroup we forget about the reflection symmetry across edge a,
#and combine the two triangles that share this edge into one.
#Again we move the origin to ab and take the x
#axis along b. There is a 4 roto-center at O'
#          |       +O'
#          y     / |  \
#          |   b=c'a=b' \
#          | /     |      y'
#        bc=O---c--+--x---  \
#         /  \     |
#       x'     a'  |
#      /         \ |
#                  

#We also now have the possibility of "vertical" and "horizontal" glide reflections.

#The sub generators below correspond to some of the more obvious symmetries
#Now the descriptions refer to our new coordinate system.
#By knocking out generators we are going to find subgroups of P4MM that
#are isomorphic to all of the wallpaper groups without 3 roto-centers.
