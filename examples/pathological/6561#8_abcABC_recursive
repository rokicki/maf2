#This is the same presentation as obrien8_aAbBcC_recursive, but with the
#order of the generators altered.
#Since the group is finite, A,B,C should all be eliminated, and a
#the confluent RWS should be the same as for that presentation
#But MAF cannot find it, because A,B,C are eliminated too soon leaving it
#with hopelessly long equations. Eventually a promising looking collapse
#takes place, but all that has happened is that finally it has eliminated
#generator c from the reduction of A. With the addition of a^27=IdWord as
#an axiom, the confluent RWS system is found in seconds.
