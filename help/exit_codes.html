<h2>Exit codes of MAF utilities</h2>
<p>The exit code, or error level, of all MAF utilities is 0 if successful. Various exit codes are used if the program fails to complete successfully:</p>
<ul><li><p>Exit code 1 is used if there is a usage error, or the input supplied to the program is invalid in some way. In this case the program aborts with an error message sent to <tt>stderr</tt>, without producing its normal output.</p></li>
<li><p>Some programs can also exit with exit code 2, which means that they have been aborted with provisional or incomplete results. This applies notably to <tt>automata</tt>, and to two programs provided for KBMAG compatibility: <tt>kbprog</tt> and <tt>kbprogcos</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Exit code 3 means that the program has failed because of an I/O error. This error would normally be caused by a required file's unexpected non existence, or inaccessibility, or by the program running out of disk space.</p></li>
</ul>
