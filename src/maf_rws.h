$Log: maf_rws.h $
Revision 1.8  2010/06/10 13:58:10Z  Alun
All tabs removed again
Revision 1.7  2010/05/16 23:24:19Z  Alun
RWSC_NO_H flag added. is_confluent() method added. Long comment changed
Revision 1.6  2009/09/13 10:21:08Z  Alun
printf() style functions cleaned up considerably
code now compiles cleanly in g++ both 32-bit and 64-bit
all tabs removed from source files
Revision 1.5  2008/11/04 22:27:50Z  Alun
Re-check in of source from web site after catastrophic loss of correct state
of RCS archive.
Revision 1.6  2008/11/04 23:27:49Z  Alun
Added facility to use RWS constructor as way of building word-acceptor
Revision 1.5  2008/10/30 09:25:24Z  Alun
Reworked to use new style packed words
Revision 1.4  2008/09/29 16:09:21Z  Alun
Switch to using Hash+Collection_Manager as replacement for Indexer.
Currently this is about 10% slower, but this is a more flexible
architecture.

/* This class is forced into a slightly unsatisfactory architecture in order
   to support KBMAG format rewriting system+index automata. KBMAG stores the
   rewriting system and the index automaton in separate files: a .kbprog file
   containing equations and a .reduce file containing the FSA. This makes
   reading and writing Rewriting_System messy compared with an ordinary FSA.
   Another annoying feature is that KBMAG wants the whole of the LHS
   present for each equation, even though for reduction all we need to know
   is how long it is. A format that stored just the RHS with padding
   characters to indicate the LHS length would be elegant and could have been
   stored using a labelled FSA structure. The LHS could always be recovered
   by seeing what we have read. On the other hand the KBMAG format renders
   the .reduce file essentially superfluous since it can be recreated from
   the .kbprog file alone, and the .kbprog file would be needed if one wanted
   to do reduction some other way, for example using the Rabin-Karp algorithm.
   But, for some presentations the rewriting system would have fewer
   states, and fewer equations if we could omit the LHS.

   We also use this class to generate .kbprog files alone from a MAF object.
   In that case the create_fsa parameter passed to the constructor is false.
