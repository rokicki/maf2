/* The user must first create a MAF object and set up the presentation of
   the object to be worked on. This will usually be done by running a
   program such as automata that reads a file containing a
   "rewriting system", but it may be done by directly calling MAF APIs.

   The object may have a previously computed structure, in which case
   various FSA describing this will have been computed, and we can simply
   load these FSA and compute with them.

   Or, more commonly, the presentation describes an unknown group or monoid
   whose structure we must deduce from the axioms. In this case the
   presentation must usually be turned into a Rewriter_Machine instance.
   Rewriter_Machine is basically a class for processing rewriting systems,
   but one in which the states and equations are labelled with pointers
   rather than integers. MAF will then use the methods provided by
   Rewriter_Machine to analyse the presentation and do one, or possibly two,
   of the following three things:

   1) It will successfully create a confluent rewriting system (explained
   below) for the group or monoid in KBMAG format. In this case we may also
   do 2) as well, unless the options supplied tell us not to.

   2) If the object described by the presentation is a group and the set of
   generators is closed under inversion, and the group is automatic with
   respect to the the chosen generators and word ordering method then the
   automatic structure is computed. This includes:
   i) various word-difference machines
   ii) the word-acceptor
   iii) the general multiplier.

   The second of these is usually the most useful, as it can be used to
   decide in linear time whether any particular word is reduced or not.
   However to reduce a word that is not accepted, the other one of the other
   machines is needed, and word reduction is quadratic.

   We may also do 2) if we are analysing a coset system.

   3) The program will run for ever until you stop it, or it has crashed
   because it has used up all the memory, or its internal limits have
   been exceeed.

   Other options
   =============

   Code to perform Tietze tranformations and do coset enumeration is
   now available, and this does not require a Rewriter_Machine (though
   the former option may well create one in a subsidiary object).

   Confluent Rewriting Systems
   ===========================

   A rewriting machine consists of a set of rewriting rules, that is
   pairs of words in which the first word, or left hand side (LHS), is to
   be replaced by the the second word (RHS), together with an automaton
   which accepts characters from a word one at a time, and can recognise
   words that are an LHS and "rewrite" the word by performing the required
   replacment. When no more rules can be applied to the input the resulting
   word is said to be reduced.

   A rewriting system generally does not give a unique possible reduction for
   every word, since if a word contains subwords for two different LHS
   then depending on which we perform first we may get a different answer.
   Such pairs of words must be equal in the group or monoid described by
   a rewriting system.  If in fact every possible path of reductions on every
   possible input word leads to the same final word the rewritig system is
   said to be confluent.

   MAF tries to create a confluent rewriting system machine corresponding to
   the object described by the axioms. Rewriter_Machine modifies the initial
   rewriting system that is created by by inserting equations corresponding
   to axioms into the the (trivial) rewriting system for the free monoid on
   the same symbols, by looking for new rules which can be deduced by finding
   two different reductions for the same input, which amounts to applying the
   associative law to this input. In order to do this the program repeatedly
   considers all "plausible pairs" of equations, until no more pairs can be
   found. If this desirable state of affairs arises the presentation is
   called "confluent".

   A pair is plausible if a suffix of the lhs of the first equation is a
   prefix of the second's lhs, and the pair has not already been considered in
   this order. (In fact the same pair of equations (in the same order) can
   be plausible in more than one way, so these "pairs" are really triples,
   consisting of the two equations and the length of the "overlap").

   As each new equation is inserted some further modifications are made to
   ensure a minimum level of consistency in the tree.

   For more details see maf_rm.cpp and the modules it refers to.

   This process is called the Knuth Bendix procedure, and it can
   take an arbitrarily long time, and may not ever terminate for infinite
   groups and monoids, because each new equation that is added creates yet
   more pairs of equations to be considered.

   Now, if a group has an shortlex automatic structure, then it can be shown
   there is a finite set of words, called the "word-differences" formed as
   follows.
   Suppose u and v are accepted words and Uv=x (with x a generator or the
   identity). The set of word-differences is the set of all group elements
   of the form p(u)^-1*p(v) where p(u) and p(v) are prefixes of the same
   length of u and v (or the whole of the shorter word in the case where
   one of the words is shorter than the other and the prefix length of the
   longer word is already longer than the whole of the shorter word). If
   we know this set we can use it to calculate the automata described above
   for the group, and when we have done so can prove that the automata
   satisfy the group axioms.
   If we know only a subset of this set, or are accepting two different
   words for the same group element in our difference machine, then when we
   try to perform this calculation something will go wrong. Also, we will
   usually end up using much more memory than we would have if we had started
   from the correct set of differences. The word-acceptor from such
   a failed calculation is of some use however - it always accepts at least
   one word for every element in the group

   The program works roughly as follows:

   0  Before each pass of KB completion MAF will decide whether to try
   to build the automata from its current best guess at the word
   differences. Usually it will only do so when:
   i) the size of this set appears to have more or less stabilised and
   ii) the new equations being formed in KB expansion are long in
   comparison to the longest known word-difference and
   iii) the "height" of the Rewriter_Machine is still increasing.

   If i) or ii) have not happened yet then we probably do not yet know
   all the word-differences. If iii) is not true, then it is quite likely that
   the presentation is confluent, so it is worth continuing the KB process.

   This step is only performed when the presentation specified a set of
   generators closed under inversion, and the option to iterate until
   confluence was not set.

   1  All the equations are kept in a tree that effectively acts as an FSA,
   and every time an equation is added, any simplifications of existing
   equations that are possible are discovered immediately and performed as
   already outlined.

   2 The process of discovering pairs of equations for KB also uses the tree
   structure to avoid the need for explicit string comparison. This saves
   a great deal of time when there are very many equations and not too many
   generators. In any one pass this program does not consider all possible
   pairs, but only pairs which satisfy certain criteria. These criteria are
   gradually relaxed, so that eventually, in the confluent case, all plausible
   pairs have been considered. In the case where confluence is never going to
   be achieved we hope our criteria have helped us find the word-differences
   in the minimum amount of time.

   3 The program also forms equations in which no prefix of the LHS is
   reducible and the lhs and rhs have no common prefix or suffix.  Such
   equations are not needed for the minimal rewriting system, but are needed
   for calculating the word-differences. Such equations do not need to be
   considered as the left partner of a plausible pair. However, they may
   be considered on the right in this implementation, though this depends
   on configuration options, and would only be useful for non-geodesic
   word orderings.

   4 When new equations are first created, unless they satisfy a length
   criterion, they are not considered when creating new equations (apart from
   in the simplification process), and are only "waiting" equations. Each
   pass of the algorithm first creates a candidate list of equations to be
   considered, then considers this list in its entirety (possibly adding a few
   new equations along the way if they are short enough), and then finally
   inspects the current list of pending equations, and adds certain of them
   (usually the shortest) to the list of "approved" equations that will
   be considered in the next KB pass. There are two classes of such equation:
   equations which do not increase the height of the tree by more than one
   are inserted into the tree at once, equations longer than this are generally
   placed in a "pool" and are only put into the tree when it has grown tall
   enough for them to be worth considering (though some longer equations will
   often be inserted, depending on what options are in effect)

   No equation is ever completely discarded until it has been proved to have a
   reducible prefix, and the reduction of the LHS and RHS do not add to our
   knowledge. This means the results of the program are definitely correct. Or,
   more accurately, MAF knows when the equation arising from an overlap might
   have been discarded, and will recreate it on a later pass.
